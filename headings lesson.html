    <!-- 
        =The text on web pages can be organized in different sections, with headings.
=Headings also help search engines like Google know what your page is about to show it to the right people.
=You can use up to 6 levels of headings in HTML. The tags for these heading elements are <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5> and <h6>.
 =h1 is the most important heading. 
 =You should only have one level 1 heading per page.
 = Heading levels need to be used in the correct order (h1, h2, …h6).
 = After your h1 you can use as many h2s as you need, after each h2 you can include h3s, and so on.
 = Many HTML elements require both opening and closing tags to contain elements.These tags are also called Container tags.
 = Some HTML elements can be defined with only one tag. They are called empty tags. The image tag <img> is a good example of an empty tag, it doesn’t require a closing tag.
