    <ul>
    <li>= A picture is worth a thousand words! Web pages with images get more views, rank higher in search results, and get shared more on social media. In this lesson, we learn to add images to web pages.</li>
<li>= Images are not technically inserted into a web page, they are linked. The source (src) of the image needs to be included in the tag.
= The valid image tag is: {<img src="image_location">} </li>
<li>= You need to tell the browser where to find the image. The source (src) is the location on the Internet where the image is stored.
Create a valid image tag: {<img src="http://www.img.jpg">} </li>
<li>= Web servers are computers that are always connected to the Internet and continuously listening for requests of information. </li>
<li>= The URL is a location (or address) on the Web. The image URL needs to be enclosed in either single or double quotes.Create a valid image tag: {<img src="..image url..">}  </li>
<li>= The web browser will struggle to understand your code if there are errors. This can result in missing elements. </li>
<li>= Errors in HTML code can include missing quotation marks, missing tags and typos in general. </li>
<li>= Images donâ€™t require closing tags. One tag (<img>) is enough to link an image to a web page. Image tags are examples of empty (non-container) tags.</li>
</ul>
