- Hey!ðŸ‘‹ Happy to see you here, at the next step of your coding journey! 
- In apps, we usually need to store some values and work with them throughout the program to make accessing them much more convenient.
- We do this by using variables, which are containers for storing values.
- Variables are created using the let keyword:
        CODE: 
            let name;
name is the name of our variable.

Variables
- After creating the variable we can give it a value. This is called initialization.
- For example:
        let name;
        name = "James";
- Now the variable name has the value "James", which is text data.
- The equal sign = is used to assign a value to our variable.

ANSWER:

Variables
- JavaScript can make it even easier!
- You can also assign your variable a value during the creation:
    Js CODE: 
        let name = "James";
        let age = 42;
- Remember, that we need to enclose text values in quotes.

Variables
- After initializing a variable, we can output its value:
    JS CODE:
        let name = "Augastine";
        console.log(name);
Click to run
- Open the Code Playground, modify the code to assign your name to the variable and output it.

..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]..Variables can change their value during the program.  ..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
Variables
- Variables can change their value during the program. That's why they are called variables ðŸ˜€!
- For example:
    JS CODE:
        let age = 17;
        //after 1 year
        age = 18;
        console.log(age);
    Click to run
- Updating the value of a variable can be done as many times as needed.

Variables
- In older versions of JavaScript, the var keyword was used instead of let, to declare variables:
    CODE PLAYGROUND: JS
        var name = 'James';
    Click to run
- let is the modern way of declaring variables and has a number of advantages over var.
- For example, var allows you to re-declare variables with the same name, while let results in an error, which makes the code safer.
- It is recommended to use let instead of var, when declaring variables.

CODE:

..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]..Constants..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
- There can be cases when you need to tell the program that the variable can't change its value throughout the 
program. Here come constants!
- Constants are similar to variables and are declared using the const keyword:
- JS CODE:
    const color = 'red';
    console.log(color);
    color = 'yellow'; //this will result in error
Click to run
- Constants must have a value when declared and they cannot change their value.
- Constants are very useful. If you use const, it tells anyone looking at your code that this variable will 
never be assigned to a different value.

    CODE:

..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]..Rules of Naming Variables ..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
- Let's talk about names.
- There are several naming rules that you need to follow in JavaScript:
    a. variable names must begin with a letter, an underscore _ or a dollar sign $
    b. variable names cannot contain spaces
    c. variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, or dollar signs.
    d. variable names are case-sensitive, which means that, for example, Name and name variables are different
JS CODE:
    //results in error because of the *
    let name* = "James";
Click to run

        Lesson Takeaways
        Fantastic job!ðŸš€ Variables are in your coding arsenal!

        Let's summarize the stuff:

        ðŸ’¡variables are containers for storing values

        ðŸ’¡variables are created with the let keyword and can change their values

        ðŸ’¡constants are created with the const keyword. They are similar to variables, but can't change their values after initialization.

        What's next?
        In the next lesson, you will learn what the difference is between 5 and "5", and what is true and false in programming. Can you guess? Data types!

            Task
            - Complete the program by creating the "width" variable with the value of 8.
            - Use the let keyword to create the variable.
