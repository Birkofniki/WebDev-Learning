    <p>
        There are millions of pages on the Web and thousands of web professionals designing and developing web pages every day.
        In this lesson you'll start applying some of the standards and best practices used in the web industry.  
    </p>
    <p>
       Standards and best practices are needed to make:
<ul>
    <li>1. web pages comptible with different browsers and devices.</li>
<li>2. teamwork and collaboration more effective</li>
</ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul> 
            <li>The &lt;body&gt; container tag is used to group everything that gets displayed on a page when loaded in a browser. </li>
                <li>Body tags are needed for your page to be compatible with all web browsers.</li>
                <li> A web page can contain only one body element.</li>
                <li> All the content elements that you need to display (like paragraphs, headings, buttons and images) need to be inside the &lt;body&gt; container tag.</li>
                <li> The &lt;body&gt; container tag needs to surround all the elements displayed on the page. When some HTML tags go inside others, this is called nesting.
                        Complete the code for body of the page
                      &lt;body&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;The content of the page&lt;/p&gt;
                        &lt;/body&gt; 
                </li>
                <li>Websites do more than just display content. The &lt;head&gt; container tag is used to include technical information about the page.</li>
                <li>You can use the head to help increase visibility and traffic from search engines like Google.
                    Title, description and keywords are nested in the head tag.
                    Complete the code to add the head
                    &lt;head&gt;
                        &lt;title>Gardening&lt;/title&gt;
                    &lt;meta name="keywords" content="apple, tree"&gt;
                <b>&lt;/head&gt;</b>
                </li> 
                <li>The head needs to be placed before the body.</li>
                <li>The information in the head is not displayed on the web page. Only the title is shown, in search engine results (e.g. Google) and in the browser tab.</li>
                <li>Today, the majority of web professionals always wrap their HTML code in &lt;html&gt; tags. The &lt;html&gt; tag is a container tag. Head and body are nested inside the &lt;html&gt; tags.</li>
                <li>Indentation is considered a very good practice to improve code readability. Indentation is the spaces at the beginning of lines.</li>
                <li>Different levels of indentation are used to show nesting.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>Lesson Takeaways:</p>
                    <p><b>Congratulations! You learned that:</b></p>
                                                        
                    <p>⭐ HTML documents can be organized into head and body</p>
                    
                    <p>​⭐ The <b>&lt;body&gt;</b> tag ensures compatibility with all browsers</p>
                    
                    <p>⭐ Indentation helps with readability and therefore collaboration</p>
                    
                    <p>In the next lesson, you'll use nesting to format the text displayed on a web page and make its content more accessible.</p>
