- Assignment operators assign values to variables.
- You already know one of them: when initializing a variable we use the = assignment operator to assign a value to it:
JS CODE: 
    let num = 5;

- It's time for some syntax sugar! JavaScript has lots of it.
- You can create different variables on the same line, separating them with commas:
    JS CODE:
        let x = 5, y = 6, z = 8;

        console.log(x);
        console.log(y);
        console.log(z);

-Let's imagine you are creating a coin collector game. The game starts with a score of 100, and when the player collects a coin the score increases by 10.
- In this case, you will write this code:
    JS CODE:
        let score = 100;
        score = score+10;
- But there is an easier way to do this. Keep going to see it!

..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]..addition assignment operator. ..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
- JavaScript lets you write the code score = score + 10 more concisely, using the += operator.
Check it out:
        JS CODE:
            let score = 100;
            score+=10;
            console.log(score);
    Click to run
- This operator is called addition assignment operator.

ANSWER CODE:
    let x = 10;
    x+=5;

..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]..NOTE: The above pattern can be followed for other arithmetic operators: ..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
- Best of all, this pattern can be followed for other arithmetic operators:
    Js CODE:
        let x = 15;
        x+=5; // x = x+5;
        x-=5; // x = x-5;
        x*=5; // x = x*5;
        x/=5; // x = x/5;
        x%=5; // x = x%5;

 ......THE EXACT CODE: .....................................................
            let x = 15;
            x+=5; // x = x+5;
            console.log(x);

            x-=5; // x = x-5;
            console.log(x);

            x*=5; // x = x*5;
            console.log(x);

            x/=5; // x = x/5;
            console.log(x);

            x%=5; // x = x%5;
            console.log(x);
    Click to run, AND THE OUTPUT IS: 
                20
                15
                75

-You can perform the same operations with two variables. 
For example:
    Js CODE:
        let price = 50;
        let rate = 1.2;
        price*=rate;//The total same as, [price = price*rate;]

- Amazing! ðŸš€ Youâ€™ve taken another step forward!
- Let's summarize what you've just learned:
    ðŸ’¡we use the assignment operator = to assign a value to a variable
    ðŸ’¡you can shorthand codes like x=x+5 with x+=5, and similar logic for all the other mathematical operations 

What's next?
- In the next lesson, you will learn more about the strings - how to escape characters, and create new lines and tabs. Keep it up!

####Bank Account Balance:
    - You want to withdraw some money from your bank account. Calculate and output the remaining balance.
    Practice

..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]..THE START OF PRACTICE ..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
        Assignment operators PRACTICE:
        - You want to withdraw some money from your bank account.
        - The program takes two numbers as input, your account balance and the amount you want to withdraw,
         and assigns them to corresponding "balance" and "withdraw" variables.
        Task:
        - Calculate and output the remaining balance after the withdrawal.
        Sample Input
        450000
        9000
        Sample Output
        441000

        Explanation:
        - The first two lines of the given code declare the balance and the withdraw variables, 
        whose values will be automatically taken as input and will be used in test cases. 
        This means that your solution will be tested with different values of those variables.
        - Don't change that part of the code and treat it as a usual variable.
        - Use the -= shorthand for easier calculation.

        ANSWER: 
        let balance = parseInt(readLine(), 10);
        let withdraw = parseInt(readLine(), 10);
        //your code goes here
        balance-=withdraw
        console.log(balance);
