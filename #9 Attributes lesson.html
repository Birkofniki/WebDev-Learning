    <ul>
        <li>You can have more control over HTML elements with attributes. </li>
    <li>Attributes are modifiers that provide additional information about elements.</li>
    <li>Attributes can be optional or required. You already know some required attributes. The image tag requires an attribute i.e 'src' to work correctly.
                 
        Complete the image tag
        
        <img src="http://www.img.png"></li>
        <p>
            For container tags, the attributes always go in the opening tag. The anchor tag is another example of an HTML element that requires an attribute to work correctly.
Complete the anchor tag

<li> <a href="https://z.com">Z</a> </li>
        </p>
        <li>href (in the anchor tag) and src (in the image tag) are examples of attributess</li>
        <li>In container tags, attributes always go…in the opening tag</li>
        <li>It's best practice to describe what images are showing. The alt attribute (alternative text) is used to add image descriptions. see example below:

            <img src="img_boy.jpg" alt="Boy in a hat"></li>
            <p>The alt attribute can be:

                <li>read aloud by screen readers</li>
                <li>shown when the image doesn't load</li> 
                <li>read by search engines</li> 
                Adding alternative text to images makes your page more accessible.... [True]...
            </p>
            <li> Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
               
                Match the examples below:
                <li>Attribute name:src</li>
                <li> Attribute value:"http://www.image.png"</li>

                </li>
                <p>
                    You can control the size of images in your web pages. width is an optional attribute.
                    Run the code to see what the web browser will display
                    <img src="http://www.img.png" width="300">
                </p>
                <p>
                    Label the name and a possible value for the attribute that controls the horizontal dimension of an image
                    name: width
                    value: "150"
                </p>
                <p>Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.</p>
                <li>height is an optional attribute for the image element. Run the code to see what the web browser will display. </li>
                                    <img src="http://www.img.png" height="150">
                
                                    <p>
                    You can provide both width and height. 
                  Run the code to see what the browser will display
                                        
                 <img src="http://www.img.png" width="200" height="130">
                </p>

                <p>
                    When only one of the 2 attributes is given, the web browser will calculate the other based on the aspect ratio so the image is not stretched or squeezed.
                   <li>True or false? The aspect ratio of an image determines its rectangular shape....ANSWER is: TRUE</li>

                   <li>Changing the aspect ratio of an image causes distortion, which can look bad. Changing the aspect ratio will result in images that are: Stretched or squeezed</li>
                </p>
    </ul>

        <li>Lesson Takeaways</li>
Well done! You learned that:
