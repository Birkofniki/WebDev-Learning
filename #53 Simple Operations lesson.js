- Simple Operations
- Let's talk about calculations! They are everywhere, including in programming. 
    So, they will be in your future programs too!
- So let's get prepared for them! ðŸ˜‰
- Performing a calculation in JavaScript is simple, just enter it into the console.log() function:
    CODE PLAYGROUND: JS
        console.log(1 + 4);
        console.log(6 - 3);
    Click to run

Simple Operations
- Just like in regular math, multiplication and division is calculated before addition and subtraction:

        console.log(5+2*3); 
    Click to run

Simple Operations
- To control precedence, use parentheses to indicate the order in which you want to perform operations, like this:
CODE PLAYGROUND: JS
    //5+2 will be calculated first
    console.log((5+2)*3);
Click to run
- Make sure to close all your parentheses.

        Lesson Takeaways
        Amazing ðŸš€!

        Let's summarize what you've just learned:

        ðŸ’¡calculations can be done directly in the console.log() function

        ðŸ’¡multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction have

        ðŸ’¡you can control the precedence using parentheses


        In the next lesson, you will learn about another key concept in programming - variables!

Simple Operations
Ever wondered how many seconds there are in a month (30 days)?

Write a program to calculate and output the answer.


Hint
Remember, there are 24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute.

Use the multiplication operator * inside the console.log() function.

   ANSWER: 
    /* 30 days
    1 day = 24 hours
    1 hour = 60 minutes
    1 minute = 60 seconds */
    //your code goes here
        console.log(60*60*24*30);
