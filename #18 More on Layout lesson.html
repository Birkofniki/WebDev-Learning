        <li>The <article> tag clearly indicates the role for its content. It's used for content like news stories, and blog posts.</li>
            So <article> is an example of:…
            -an empty tag.
            -a semantic tag.-[ANSWER]

        <li>Layout tags like <header>, <main>, <footer> and <article> are semantic tags because they…</li>

        <li>A web page could be split into separate sections for introduction, contact information, etc.</li>
            So <section> is:…
            -an empty tag
            -a container tag -[ANSWER]

        <li>The tag <section> can be used to separate each chapter, news item, etc.</li>
