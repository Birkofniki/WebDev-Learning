        Comments help other humans to read your code.
You can add notes or explanations to your code with the comment tag: <!-- … -->
= It's a good practice to use comments in your HTML code. They explain what the code does. Complete the code to create a comment

<!--Heading below-->
<h3>Product features</h3>
= Comments will help others (and future you!) to understand the code. 
= Comments are ignored by browsers and not displayed on the web page.

= You can use comments to temporarily disable part of your code so it's not displayed by the browser.
Complete the code to disable the button
<!--<button>OK</button> -->
= HTML is a case-insensitive language. This means that the web browser will understand the tags in both upper and lowercase form.
NB:....It's good practice to use lowercase, to make your code consistent and easy to read.

= The web browser will ignore white spaces and line breaks in your code. Still, it's a good practice to organize your code into different lines so it’s easier to read by humans.
= If you need to create a line break you can use the <br> tag. <br> will force a line break.
Complete the code so the text is displayed in 2 lines

<p>First line of text. <br>
Second line of text.</p>

= Elements like headings and paragraphs automatically start on a new line when you create them.
