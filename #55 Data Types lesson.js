- You are making great progress!
- Another important concept in programming is data types.
- The term 'data type' refers to the types of values a program can work with.
- We've already gotten familiar with two types of data: text and number.
- Text in quotes, like "Hello World" is called a string.
    CODE PLAYGROUND: JS
        let msg = "I am a string";
        let msg2 = 'I am a string as well';
        console.log(msg);
        console.log(msg2);
    Click to run
- As we have seen, we can use single or double quotes to create strings.

- Everything in quotes is a string, even numbers.
For example:
    Js CODE:
        console.log("42");
    Click to run
- In the code above, 42 is a string, not a number, which means that the program will treat it as a text consisting of two symbols: "4" and "2".

    let myNum = "14"; 
    CHOICES:
    number
    string ===

..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]..Numbers ..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
- Numbers can be written with or without decimals.
    CODE PLAYGROUND: JS
            let x = 5; //whole number
            let y = 8.45; //decimal
        Click to run
- Use dot . for decimals.

    ANSWER: 
        const pi = 3.14;

..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]..You can add, subtract and multiply numbers, producing another number as a result. ..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
Some examples:
    CODE PLAYGROUND: JS
        let x = 54;
        let y = 6;
        console.log(x*y);
        console.log(x/y);
    Click to run

ANSWER: 
    let x = 16;
    let y= 4;
    console.log(x/y);

- Very often, in programming, you will need a data type that can only have one of two values.
- For example, to create a registration form for a website you may need to have a variable to check whether the user accepted terms and conditions - two possible scenarios: yes or no.
- For this, JavaScript has the Boolean data type which can only take the values true or false.
    CODE PLAYGROUND: JS
        let isActive = true;
        let isHoliday = false;
        
        console.log(isActive);
        console.log(isHoliday);
    Click to run
- There are also numerical representations of Boolean values - know that 1 means true, and 0 is false.

    -   You are unstoppable!ðŸš€ This was the last lesson of this module, and you nailed it! ðŸ’ª
    Here is a quick summary:

        ðŸ’¡the term data type refers to the types of values a program can work with.
        ðŸ’¡everything in quotes is a string, even numbers
        ðŸ’¡both whole numbers and decimals in JavaScript belong to the one number data type
        ðŸ’¡boolean data type is used to only have one of two values: true or false

   CODE:  let IknowDataTypes = true;
   
    What's next?
    In the next lesson, you will learn about operators. Also, you will get a deeper understanding of strings. 
    See you there!
