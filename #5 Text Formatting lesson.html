<li>Text formatting is used to highlight the important content on a page and can make your web pages more accessible and inclusive.</li>
<li>HTML formatting tags are used to change how text is displayed.</li>
<li>The bold tag &lt;b&gt; is used to display text in bold.</li>

<ol>
<li>The italic tag &lt;i&gt; is used to display text in italics.</li>

</ol>
<li>Web pages are designed to be accessible by people with disabilities. Web accessibility is all about making websites more inclusive and removing barriers. Screen readers are programs that make the content of a web site accessible to users who are blind, visually impaired or have a learning disability.</li>
<li> There are some HTML formatting tags that you can use to make your web pages more accessible. </li>
The strong tag &lt;strong&gt; is used to highlight important text.
For xample: <strong>Warning</strong>
<li>Strong text is displayed in bold, just like when you use the bold &lt;b&gt; tag. The difference is that the strong &lt;strong> tag also has meaning and is used by screen readers.</li>
<li>The emphasis tag &lt;em&gt; is used to define emphasized text.</li>
 For Example: to empasize the phrase 'The Book of Life', Add the emphasis tags as below:
    
    <em>The Book of Life</em>
    </li>
<li>Emphasized text is displayed in italic, just like when you use the &lt;i&gt; tag. The difference is that the screen reader will verbally stress the words.</li>
<li>The &lt;strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt; tags are considered semantic formatting tags because they add meaning to the content. They can serve as an indication of emphasis to a screen reader.</li>
<p>
<ul>
    <li>Lesson Takeaways</li>

 <li>⭐ You can use nesting to make the text bold, italic and underlined with the <b>, <i> and <u> formatting tags</li>
