    <p>HTML code tells the browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, etc.) how to display a web page.

You'll start writing, running and testing real HTML code in this lesson to build the structure of a web page.
Many HTML elements require both opening and closing tags.
Closing tags are very similar to the opening tags. The only difference is that they contain a forward slash /.
You can customize the text for the button. The content of the button is placed between the tags.
Many elements require both opening and closing tags, also known as container tags. The paragraph text is another example.
Complete the code for a valid paragraph text
You can combine multiple elements in your code. 
What's the content of this web page?
Ready to write, run and test real HTML code? The Code Playground allows you to do that.
Open the code below and hit "Run" to see what the web browser will display.
Did you notice you could modify the text? Have some fun changing the code! Can you add another element?
Your web browser (e.g. Chrome, Safari, etc.) can read HTML code and translate it into what you see when you surf the web.
A web browser translates HTML code into web.

        <li>Lesson Takeaways</li>
Amazing! You learned that:

<li>‚≠ê Elements like buttons and paragraph text require container tags</li>

<li>‚≠ê Container tags consist of both opening < > and closing </> tags</li>

<li>‚≠ê You can use the Code Playground to write, run and test real HTML code</li>

In the next lesson, you'll learn about a new HTML element: the heading.üöÄ</li>
