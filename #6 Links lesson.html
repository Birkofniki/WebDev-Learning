    <title>Links Lesson #6</title>
</head>
<body>
    <ul>
        <li>The Web wouldn't be possible without HyperText. HyperText is what lets people jump from one web page to another, through links.</li>
        <li>HyperText is text that contains a link to another page. </li>
        <li>Web pages are called HyperText documents because they are connected by HyperText links (or hyperlinks)</li>
        <li>Hyperlinks allow users to [1]MOVE from one web page to another; and also [2]. share INFORMATION across different machines and systems</li>
        <li>The anchor tag &lt;a&gt; is used to create a hyperlink on a web page. The &lt;a&gt; tag is a container tag. </li>
       <p>Hyperlinks are used to link from one web page to others. To create a link, you need "href" to add the destination URL.</p> 

           <li> href stands for HyperText reference.</li>
            
            <p>E.g Complete the line of code to create a hyperlink</p>
            
           <li> &lt;a href="url">Z&lt;/a&gt; </li> 
           <li> &lt;a href="url"&gt;Text &lt;/a&gt; </li>
           <li>The URL needs to be enclosed in quotes to work without errors, either single or double quotes are okay. If you forget to add href or the quotes, the &lt;a&gt; tag won't create a hyperlink. i.e URLs can be enclosed in matching single (') or double quotes ("). There is no difference as long as they match.</li>
<p>What's wrong with this line of code?

    &lt;a "https://www.sololearn.com"&gt;Sololearn&lt;/a&gt; </p>
    <p><li>The href is missing</li></p>

       <p>You can nest hyperlinks inside other text elements.
    Run the code to see what the web browser will display </p>
    
    <p>Have a look at <a href='https://www.wikipedia.org'>Wikipedia</a></p>
    <li>The content of the anchor tag &lt;a&gt; is the text that you want to display. </li>
   <p> You can also use hyperlinks to connect pages of the same website.
The part of the URL that stays the same for all of a website's pages is the domain name (e.g. sololearn.com). </p>
<li>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</li>
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.

The "HyperText" is because web pages have LINKS.
"Markup" refers to the SYMBOLS like &lt;/&gt;.
