    The way visitors navigate a website depends on its design. Websites come in 2 shapes:
- Multiple-page websites

- Single-page websites.

In this lesson, you'll learn to help users to find what they're looking for with navigation links.
</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>The way visitors navigate your website has a big impact on USER experience, Search Engine rankings,and therefore even sales.</li>
        <li> Multi-page websites are made of more than one page.</li>
        <li>Navigating between pages requires the web browser to load different HTML files.</li>
        <li>The &lt;nav&gt; container tag defines a set of links that allows the user to navigate between pages of a website. see the example below;</li>
        <p>
<nav>           
<a href="index.html">Home</a>
<a href="about.html">About</a>
<a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
</nav>
        </p>
        <li>Links to the different pages are added with the anchor tag &lt;a&gt; and nested inside the &lt;nav&gt; container tag.</li>
        <nav>
            <a href="index.html">Home</a>
            <a href="about.html">About</a>
            <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
        </nav>
            
        <li>The HTML project for a multi-page website is made of different HTML documents (or files). For instance how many files will this project contain?</li>
        <li>HTML documents must be saved with the right file extension (file type) for web browsers to recognize them. QUIZ: What do you think is the file extension for an HTML document?</li>
        <li>This website also has a Blog page, with the file name blog.html. Can you add a link to it from this homepage?
            Yes..added to the last </li>
            <nav>
                <a href="index.html">Home</a>
                <a href="services.html"> Services</a>
                <a href="products.html"> Products</a>
               <a href="blog.html"> Blog</a>
               </nav>

        <li>A single-page website has all its content on the home page. Any navigation links take the visitor down to different sections (instead of loading new pages).</li>
        <li>It's best practice to name your homepage index.html so that the web browser can find and load it.</li>
        <li>To jump to a specific part of a single-page website, first you need to mark the section with the id (ID) attribute.</li>
        <li>Complete the line of code to mark the heading element with an id. </li>
            <h2 id="section-1">Section 1</h2>

        <li>The id attribute is used to identify the element you want to target with the navigation link. 
            Each id attribute value must be:</li>
            <li>unique</li>
            <li>within quotes</li>
            <h2 id="s1">Section 1</h2>

        <li>Once the element you want to jump to has been marked with an id, you can target it with an anchor tag &lt;a&gt;....See an example below:</li>

<a href="#s1">Go to S1 </a>
<h2 id="s1">Section 1</h2>

        <li>The hash character (#) is needed to tell the web browser that we are targeting a section of the same page. See and run the code to see what the web browser will display:</li>
            
            <nav>
               <a href="#s1">Jump to S1</a>
               <a href="#s2">Jump to S2</a>
               <a href="#s3">Jump to S3</a>
            </nav>

        <li>You might want to add a link at the bottom of a long single-page website to take the user back to the top of the page. You can do this with href="#top" or simply href="#". </li>
        <li>Single-page vs. multi-page website design is one of the first decisions you need to make for a new website project. Both options have their pros and cons, as you'll soon find out on this course.
