      <li>JavaScript is one of the core web technologies alongside HTML and CSS.</li>
            <li>Match the description with the web technology..</li>
    CHOICES:
        -Controls the structure of a web page: HTML
        -Controls the presentation of a web page: CSS
        -Controls the behavior of a web page: JavaScript

      <li>Did you know?
        The web was originally designed and developed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in the '90s.
        The first prototype enabled scientists to share information between different universities and research institutes around the world.</li>

      <li>img-component...[<img src="images/web evolvement js.webp">]
            The web has evolved so much since it was invented at CERN.
            The first iteration of the web was read-only, with no interaction or design elements.
            The second iteration, also known as read-write web, made the web social with applications like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter and enabled the user to become a content creator.</li>

      <li>img-component..-[<img src="images/internet and web.webp">]
        While the internet and the web are not exactly the same thing, the two terms are often used interchangeably.
        The web is the largest application on the internet.</li>

      <li>HTML was the perfect choice! Now you know it, there's so much you can build! 
        And now you'll pick up the other programming languages much quicker too.
