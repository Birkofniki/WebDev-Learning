- We met strings in the previous lessons, but now itâ€™s time to get better acquainted.
- Remember, we can create a string by entering text between two single or double quotation marks.
- Like this:
    js CODE:
        let msg = "Hey!";
        let msg2 = 'Keep it up!';
        
        console.log(msg);
        console.log(msg2);
    Click to run, and the output will be:
        Hey! 
        Keep it up! 

..]]]]]]]]]]..You can use quotes inside the strings, 
            just make sure that they are different from the enclosing ones. ..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
- For example:
Js CODE:
    console.log("I'm happy!");
    console.log('She said "Yes!"');
Click to run, and the output should be: 
        I'm happy! 
        She said "Yes!"

..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]..Escape Character ..]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
- In JavaScript, the backslash \ is a special character, called the escape character.
- It is used to represent certain things in a string, such as new lines, tabs, and other useful things.
- Don't confuse it with the division operator /.

- If you want to include a quote in a string, you need to escape it using a backslash. In this case, you don't need to use different enclosing quotes.
For example:
    CODE PLAYGROUND: JS
        console.log('I'm happy');//error
        console.log('I\'m happy');
        console.log("She said \"Yes!\"");
    Click to run, and the output should be: 
            I'm happy 
            She said "Yes!"

- The backslash is also used to create new lines in text.
- To create a new line we use \n.
- For example:
    Js CODE:
        console.log("One \nTwo \nThree");
    Click to run, and the answer should be: 
        One 
        Two
        Three

Tab
- Similar to a new line, we can create a tab using \t:
    CODE PLAYGROUND: JS
        console.log("\t hey \t there");
    Click to run, and the result should be: 
    	 hey 	 there

                You rock! ðŸš€

        - Let's summarize what you've just learned:

                ðŸ’¡you can include a quote in a string if it's different from the ones that enclose it

                ðŸ’¡as an alternative, you can escape it using the backslash

                ðŸ’¡you can use \n for a new line and \t for a tab

        What's next?
        Is it possible to use a variable inside a string? Here come template literals with tons of new opportunities for working with strings.
