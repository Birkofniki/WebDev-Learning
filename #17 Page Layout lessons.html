        <ul>
            <li>The layout of a web page can improve user experience and make the content more readable.<br>
                In this lesson, you'll learn to apply a layout to your web pages.</li>

            <li>The body of a web page can be divided into 3 parts.</li>
                Match the part with its HTML tag:
                Header:<header>
                Main content:<main>
                Footer: <footer>
                
            <li>The <header> container tag usually contains introductory information.</li>
                <header>
                <!--Introductory information-->
                </header>

            <li>NB:You can add several header elements to a web page.</li>

            <li>The header often contains navigation links, a menu and/or a search bar. Brand elements like logos are usually found in the header too.</li>
                <header>
                <!--Introductory information-->
                </header>
                
            <li>The <main> container tag is used to include the main content of a web page.</li>
                <main>
                <!--main content-->
                </main>
                
            <li>NB: There must not be more than one <main> element in a document.</li>

            <li>The &lt;footer&gt; container tag often contains contact and legal information and links.</li>
                <footer>
                    <!--footer information-->
                </footer>
                
            <li>NB: You can have several <footer> elements in one document.</li>

            <li> The <header>, <main> and <footer> elements are nested inside the <body> container tag see image below:</li>
                ..............
                <img src="images/header,main, and footer.webp">
                <body>
                  <header>

                  </header>
                  <main>
                     <!--main content--> 
                  </main>
                  <footer>
                     <!--footer information--> 
                  </footer>
                </body>
