    What is CSS:
    CSS allows you to define styles for web pages.
    It can be used to style text, change colors, font size, etc., as well as create layout - for example, create
    columns, sidebars, navigation menus, etc.
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.


    CSS stands for:
    Casting Style Sheets
    Cascading Some Styles
    Cascading Selection Styles
    Cascading Style Sheets===

    What is CSS
    CSS uses rules to style elements.
    A rule is a group of style declarations.
    An example rule could define all paragraphs to be red and large.
    The style declarations have the following syntax:
    property: value;
    Each declaration specifies a property of the element(s) we are targeting, then a value that we'd like to give the
    property.

    A CSS rules includes:
    paragraphs
    style declarations===
    elements

    CSS
    There are a number of ways we can apply CSS rules to our elements.
    The first way is to define the style declarations right on the element we target, using the style attribute.
    For example:
    CODE:
    <p style="color:red">some text</p>
    Run to see:
    Run the code to see the style applied to the paragraph.



    QUIZ:Fill in the blank to define a style for the paragraph:
    <p style="color:yellow">some text</p>

    CSS:
    We can have multiple declarations in the style rule:
    CODE:
    <p style="color:red; font-size:26px">some text</p>
    Click to run
    The declarations are separated using a semicolon.
    Task: Change the code to apply a blue color to the paragraph and increase its font size to 42px.


    QUIZ: Which attribute is used to add style declarations to an element?
    css
    add
    style===
    class

    NOTE:
    -Using the style attribute on HTML elements applies the style to that element only.
    -But what if we wanted to apply the same style to multiple paragraphs?
    -We would have to copy the same style attribute and define it on all the paragraphs.
    -This would make a lot of redundant code, and make it very hard to change the style in the future.

    NOTE2:
    - It is common practice to define the CSS rules in a separate document and link it with the HTML.
    -CSS allows you to target elements using selectors, which allows you to target specific elements and apply the same
    style to them.
    -We will learn about selectors and see a CSS file in action in the next lesson.
